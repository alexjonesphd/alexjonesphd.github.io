# What I do
I am a **Senior Lecturer** in Psychology at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/alex.l.jones).

Historically, I've broadly researched face perception from various angles. Over the years I've explored topics like:

- How aspects of **facial colouration** relate to actual and perceived health
- The way **cosmetics** are used to alter social perceptions
- Whether faces carry any information about **physical and mental health**
- What influences **facial attractiveness**, and what attractiveness means

Over the last few years, my interests have shifted to improving scientific and statistical practice in psychology. I am particularly interested in **Bayesian inference** and its potential to model complex psychological processes, as well as how data science/machine learning methods can give new insights in psychology. Some recent examples include:

- **Regularised regressions** for selecting variables that impact social perception
- Automating face research processes with **deep learning frameworks**
- Applying **hierarchical Bayesian models** to randomised controlled trials of sleep interventions
- Using **big data** sets of dating profiles to test evolutionary hypotheses
