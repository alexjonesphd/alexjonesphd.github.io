# Data Science and Statistics Consulting

### Do you have a problem with data?
I have over a decade of experience in working with social science data, both behavioural, as well as some electrophysiological. I've been fortunate to work with many industry partners over my career, including **Boots**, **Chanel**, and more recently **CyDen Ltd**, **eharmony**, and **Vanquis**.

Some of the things (but not all) I can help with:

- Experimental and survey design
- Rapid data collection
- Providing statistical expertise for grant submissions
- Undertaking power analysis (via simulation) of complex models
- Cleaning messy data (no data too messy!)
- Building statistical models
- Helping to interpret fitted models
- Clear and concise communication to non-expert or lay audiences of results

I love solving problems with data, so if there's something you're stuck with, feel free to reach out! 

# Skills 
I am highly proficient in both `Python` and `R`, with a preference for the former. I've been using both languages for nearly ten years and have analysed small survey data through to experimental tasks with 20-million rows, conducting a wide range of statistical analyses such as hierarchical general linear models, factor analysis and principal components analysis, clustering, and produced complex data visualisations. I specialise in Bayesian statistical modelling, and love using this to properly quantify uncertainty and build probabilistic forecasts. Check out my [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/v3p5g) page for many examples.

# Pricing
Like much of statistical inference, this depends! Get in touch about your problem or project and I can provide an estimate for how long it might take. I offer an hour free consultation to discuss project needs.
