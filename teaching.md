## Teaching experience
I have over ten years experience of teaching and presenting in higher education, and have been a certified lecturer for four years and a member of the **Higher Education Academy**. I have a taught a range of topics including social psychology and evolution and human behaviour, but I consider my biggest teaching achievement the development of a Python for data analysis module.

I am passionate about **data literacy** and statistical inference, and believe that the ability to work with and understand data is a key skill today. Unfortunately, it can be perceived as difficult or inaccessible to newcomers.  My class introduces students to the use of Python for formatting, plotting, and analysing modern data. I've expanded the class notes significantly and have released them here - feel free to take a look if you're interested in getting started with Python! The course starts at the very basics and works its way up to fitting general and hierarchical models.

## Talks and Public Engagement
While analysing data is great, the insights gained are of no use if they cannot be communicated clearly. I've done a range of writing and presenting to different audiences, from the general public, business partners, and academic audiences. Some examples are below:
